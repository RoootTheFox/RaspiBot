# RaspiBot
A discord bot written in Java.

You can invite the official bot [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=622020397449216000&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands).

The default Prefix for this Bot is `/`.<br>
The default alternative Prefix for this Bot is `-`.<br>

This bot will likely switch to using Discord's new Slash Commands when JDA adds support for them.
For the time being, you can put a space in front of Commands to avoid other bot's Slash Commands from being run instead.
